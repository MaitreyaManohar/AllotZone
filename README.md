# AllotZone
 Hey buddies, this is a hostel allotment app that I made using flutter.
 Unfortunately, since I don't have a Mac/Macintosh I couldn't build the app for IOS devices. 
 
 Please download app-release.apk in the root directory to try the app
 
 ## Features

  - Confirmation requests to other wing members are sent through an email, they can respond by rejecting or accepting the request through the app.
  - Facility to swap rooms after selecting rooms
  - Admin access to vacate or block rooms.
